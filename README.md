Being Collabrative Creating a Podcast
==========

A collabrative podcast requires people to shae quickly the topics at hand and to cover all items that need to be handeled in a timely fashion. 

This web app helps with that flow, allowing individual guests and the host to create a real-time script for an episode and to publish "show notes" to a "episode" web page.
